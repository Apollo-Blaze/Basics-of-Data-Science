## About

I am currently learning data science to enhance my skills and knowledge in this rapidly growing field. This repository will serve as a comprehensive log of my learning journey, containing resources, projects, notes, and any other relevant materials I come across.

## Goals

1. Gain a solid understanding of fundamental data science concepts.
2. Learn and apply various data analysis and visualization techniques.
3. Get proficient in using popular data science tools and libraries like Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.
4. Work on real-world data science projects to build a strong portfolio.
5. Prepare for data science interviews and certification exams.

## Projects

I will be working on various projects to apply what I learn. Here are some of the projects I plan to undertake:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing datasets to uncover patterns and insights.
2. **Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations to communicate data findings effectively.
3. **Machine Learning Models:** Building and evaluating different machine learning models.
4. **Capstone Project:** A comprehensive project that integrates multiple aspects of data science.
